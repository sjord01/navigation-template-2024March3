    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This project serves as a portfolio for myself; I'm aiming to transition from an engineering technologist career field into software development.
            My intents for these web pages are to host briefs of projects I will be working on in the future and short articles of tech-related topics I've
            learned in my journey.
        </p>

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>This personal portfolio's objectives are to highlight my skills, what makes me unique, and everything I've learned.
            More sprecifically:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li-body">This portfolio project will serve as an online resume I could give to recruiters or clients I will be working with in the future.</li>
            <li class="li-body">It will showcase projects I've worked on throughout my career. I'm currently learning Django and Kotlin, I want to challenge myself and
                be able to feature how I am trying my best to be a polyglot in terms of programming languages.
            </li>
            <li class="li-body">It serves as an archive for articles that contains tech-related learnings throughout my lifetime learning. It serves as a good reference for
                myself to have important concepts ready at hand in my blog section; it's also a good reference for other people to learn from.

        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>
            Here ar the main target audiences of my portfolio:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li-body">Recruiters; for future tech-career prospects</li>
            <li class="li-body">Employers/Clients; for future tech-career prospects</li>
            <li class="li-body">Software Developers/Aspiring Developers; the portfolio will host blogs I've written about my programming-related learnings</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Although, i have listed the main target audiences I wish to have, I have planned the design to be universal and minimal such that anyone
            who has access to it can have an easy understanding of my online bio. Furthermore, in regards to the character or tone that the portfolio
            evokes, I've chosen specific colours to help achieve what I am trying to convey:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li-body">orange(#FE7A36): <em>'bold'/'boldness'</em>; a reference to my personal choice of going back to school to learn programming and build new networks</li>
            <li class="li-body">pink(#FF407D): <em>'feminine'</em>; to cater to audiences identifying to the femininity</li>
            <li class="li-body">dark blue(#1B3C73): <em>'masculine'</em>; to cater to audiences identifying to the 'masculinity'</li>
            <li class="li-body">purple(#525CEB): <em>'elegance'</em>; to evoke elegance using the know royalty color, purple, in combination with the cohesive hues of colours chosen</li>
            <li class="li-body">light blue(#A4BEEA), light pink(#FFCAD4), light purple(#A4A9F4): <em>'clean'/'cleanliness'</em>; the lighter shades of the main colour pallette will solidify the minimal and accessible design aesthetics for the portfolio.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="img-feature">
