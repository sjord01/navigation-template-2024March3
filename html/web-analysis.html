        <h2>Analysis of Similar Portfolio Pages</h2>
        <p>
            Here are two examples of existing portfolio websites that I admire. Both of them features design aesthetics, good usage of layout, spot-on copy-writing that I aspire to achieve:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a class="external" href="https://harryjatkins.com/" target="_blank">Harry Atkins</a>
                <ul>
                    <li class="li-body">The layout of the portfolio site; from the tiles/cards in the homepage that shows project information, and eventually leading to an individual page to showcase the project that was clicked, features good planning of what information to show initially to the audience.</li>
                    <li class="li-body">The website features a mobile-friendly structure without compromising the visual design overall.</li>
                    <li class="li-body">Fonts are clean and sharp</li>
                </ul>
            <li><a class="external" href="https://www.pentagram.com/" target="_blank">Pentagram</a>
                <ul>
                    <li class="li-body">The portfolio section is heavily image-based in terms of visual presentation; it's an awesome way to show the audience what they do as a design studio company. Clicking into the tiles just takes you further more to combinations of images and project descriptions you need to know about the project.</li>
                    <li class="li-body">The navigation design is simple yet crisp; this creates an easier user-experience for the audience</li>
                    <li class="li-body">The photos used and the animations on the website do not overpower the messages the site is trying to convey in itself.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>

    <h2>Frequently Visited Site</h2>
        <p>
            Bolt, founded in early 2014, launched its checkout platform in mid-2016 and has since focused on providing a composable commerce solution to enterprise merchants, enabling them to maintain brand identity while leveraging Bolt's technology to personalize and scale their shopper account network, currently serving tens of millions of shoppers.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've bookmarked this SaaS (Service as a Platform) website and visited it a lot to add as one, among many, of the websites that teach me how to adopt best practices in building websites.
            It's main objective is to clearly communicate how they are disrupting the e-commerce business by engineering solutions to unify the typical aspects involved in online shopping workflow.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="li-body">The website features companies they have worked with and reviews from their users; these things help build trust to their intended audiences</li>
            <li class="li-body">The layout flow communicates what they do as a company and clearly explains the kind of service and product they are offering through good usage of images, fonts, colours, and clear copywriting.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Colours in website</h2>
        <p>The Bounce website uses three punchy main colours in their design: purple(#6609FC), teal(#14C0C0), and neon yellow green(#DBFF00).</p>
        <blockquote>
            It's ok to show all your colours. - Luis Guzman
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            The colours live a remarkable life of their own after they have been applied to the canvas. - Edward Munch
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            I try to apply colours like words that shape poems, like notes that shape music. - Joan Miro

        <h2>Website Layout</h2>
        <p>When in doubt, use CSS grids!</p>
        <p>Take a look at this website promoting a specific Nike sneaker collection: <a class="external" href="https://nikebauhaus.vercel.app/" target="_blank">Nike Bahaus</a></p>
        <p>The usage of grid structure is verry effective to showcase the product itself, marketing images that support it, and even texts that add more context about it.</p>
